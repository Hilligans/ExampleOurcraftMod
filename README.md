# ExampleOurcraftMod
 
To run this while in development you must run the client main or server main in the Ourcraft jar

The provided Ourcraft jar may be out of date when downloading this example project, to update it you must download the main ourcraft repo and run the mvn package command. You can then go to the target/ folder and copy the file named Ourcraf-1.0.jar and replace the out of date jar.

To package this into a mod simply run mvn package and it will assemble it into a jar which will be located in the target/ folder.

Placing a packaged jar file into the mods folder will allow it to be loaded by the main game.
